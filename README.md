<h1>FighterZ</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
   Our game is called FighterZ. This game has a character that you can control to fight other characters. This consist of using the keyboard and adding multiple animations. The goal of the game is to get the other character's health to zero and beat them before the timer runs out. We’ll be using a sprite sheet that has many different animations on it so that we have to crop it ourselves. We’re going to have a character selecting screen where you can choose who you want to be for the game. Some challenges that are going to be in the game are setting the timer, health bar, and other features. Also, this fighting game will have a two player mode with different keys to use, so that’ll be another challenge to face. This game is very similar to the King of Fighters or Street Fighters. I think the most challenging part of making this game is that we’re using multiple animation on one object and control that. This goes the same with the other player. One thing that’s also going to be new to us is that we’re going to add a character screen where u can use your mouse to choose the character that you’re going to play during the game.
